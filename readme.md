Why did you choose this subject?

- I chose to learn Three.js after looking on the Three.js website and seeing some really impressive projects.

How were you first made aware of it?

- Through the Teach Yourself repo

What problem does it solve?

- Often websites can appear static or boring if there is no visual depth.

How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?

- Three.js has a large library that allows the user to add lighting and other effects to give the appearance of 3-d.

Why does one use it?

- For visual pop
What are the alternatives?

- Three.js appears to be the leading library for 3-d javascript. However, there are other animation libraries out there that focus on more 2-d visuals.

What is it similar to, if anything?

- Nothing I've seen

What is the history of this technology?

- The project started with Ricardo Cabello. Cabello created the first Three.js GitHub repo in 2009. Since then, several hundred people have contributed to the library's source code.

What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?

- It's a great library. Tons of functionality built in.

What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?

- Just wrapping my head around Three.js' custom methods. Still, I found it be relatively intuitive.

What resources do you recommend for interested students?

- An excellent YouTube channel with a series of 8 Three.js tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqjwgTAGQRY&t=312s

What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?

- The YouTube channel referenced above.

What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?

- "Explain how you might use Three.js in a professional setting."
  "What is your greatest strength in Three.js?"
  "What would you like to improve on in Three.js?"

- To run this app in a development setting, simply clone down this repo. Note: if you are planning to import 3d models from Blender, then you will need to run a local server. In that instance, simply run npm install --save http-server and run the app locally from localhost:8080.
